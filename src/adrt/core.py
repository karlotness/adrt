r"""Low-level routines for observing or influencing the basic algorithms.

The ``adrt.core`` module provides low-level routines that make it
possible to observe the progress of other iterative algorithms
provided in this package, or to intervene in their computation.

Broadly, there are two types of routines provided here: generators
which yield snapshots of each phase in the iterative computation; and
single-step functions which allow executing a single, specified step.

These routines could be used to implement the basic routines from the
:mod:`adrt` module; however the implementations there are more
efficient. If you only want the final result of the basic algorithms,
you should use the functions from the main :mod:`adrt` module.

However, if you want to observe or modify the progress of the basic
algorithms, these routines make this possible. If you want only to
observe the individual steps of the iterative computations---but not
modify them---then the iterator routines here may be useful.
Otherwise, if you want to perform more advanced operations and
intervene in and modify the progress of the computations, the
single-step routines make that possible.
