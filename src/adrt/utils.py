r"""Utility routines for visualization or further processing.

The ``adrt.utils`` module contains routines which are useful for
visualization or other basic processing tasks. These routines help to
transform outputs from the core algorithms into forms which may be
easier to process elsewhere, for example by aligning the quadrants of
the ADRT into a single contiguous image, or interpolating the
irregular ADRT angles into a regular spacing.

    r"""Reshape and align ADRT quadrants output into a contiguous image.

    The ADRT routine, :func:`adrt.adrt`, produces an output array
    which is divided into four separate quadrants, each containing the
    Radon transform results for a range of angles. This routine
    stitches these channels together so that they form a contiguous
    output. This may be especially useful in order to visualize the
    output as an image.

    The input array should have the *relative* shape of an ADRT output
    (but the base dimension ``N`` need not be a power of two). Any
    number of optional leading dimensions will be treated as batch
    dimensions and will be preserved in the output.

    The output array will be four times as wide as any one original
    quadrant (with four fewer columns if `remove_repeated` is
    :pycode:`True`), and will have an additional ``N-1`` rows added.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : numpy.ndarray
        Array of ADRT output data to be stitched.
    remove_repeated : bool, optional
        If :pycode:`False` (default) all columns are preserved in the
        output. If :pycode:`True`, the redundant last column in each
        quadrant is removed.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The input data repositioned to form a contiguous array.

    Notes
    -----
    The columns which are removed by `remove_repeated` are only truly
    redundant if `a` has the symmetries of a real ADRT output.

    See :ref:`adrt-description` for a description of the ADRT output
    quadrants.

    The function :func:`unstitch_adrt` provides an inverse for this
    operation.

    ADRT output arrays consist of four rectangular quadrants with

    This function fixes both aspects. It slices each ADRT quadrant
    into a square, and rotates them so that they are stacked in a
    consistent orientation (in particular, this forms an inverse for
    :func:`adrt.core.adrt_init`).

    For this routine the input array `a` must have the same *relative*
    shape of an ADRT output, but the base dimension ``N`` need not be

    The ADRT sums values in an input image along lines of pixels.
    These lines are selected to approximate continuous lines at
    various angles, and meet the edge of the input image at each
    possible offset.

    This function computes the offset and angle for each entry in the
    :class:`array <numpy.ndarray>` output of :func:`adrt.adrt`. These
    are returned as a pair :pycode:`(offset, angle)`.

    The integer argument `n` specifies the size of the ADRT domain.
    This is the size of the :math:`N \times N` input image or
    equivalently the final dimension of the ADRT output with shape
    :pycode:`(4, 2*n-1, n)`.

    The return value `output`, contains the offset coordinate of each
    ADRT component and has the same size as the ADRT output.

    The `angle` return value stores the angles in radians that the
    corresponding digital line is designed to approximate. This array
    is squeezed to save memory and is broadcastable with the full ADRT
    output. Consider :func:`numpy.broadcast_to` to expand this array
    to full size, if desired.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The size of the ADRT domain. Either the size of the input
        image :pycode:`(n, n)`, or equivalently the final dimension of

    -------
    offset : numpy.ndarray of numpy.float64
        3D array of dimensions :pycode:`(4, 2*n-1, n)` containing
        Radon domain offset coordinates of the ADRT domain for each of
        four quadrants.
    angle : numpy.ndarray of numpy.float64

        domain theta (angle) coordinates of the ADRT domain for each
        of four quadrants in radians. These angles are measured in

    Given points :math:`(\theta, t)` in the continuous Radon domain,
    where :math:`\theta` is in radians and t is in normalized
    coordinates between :math:`-1/\sqrt{2}` and :math:`1/\sqrt{2}`,
    find the index of the closest corresponding entry in an ADRT
    output. This is the digital ADRT line with height and slope most
    closely matching these input coordinates.

    This function can be used to find entries in the ADRT that most
    closely approximate a line in a continuous Radon transform. The
    input arrays `theta`, and `t` represent the continuous (Cartesian)
    Radon coordinates :math:`\theta` and :math:`t`, respectively.

    The argument `n` gives the size of the ADRT domain over which to
    query. This is the size of the :math:`N \times N` input image or
    equivalently the final dimension of the ADRT output with shape
    :pycode:`(4, 2*n-1, n)`.

    Coordinates are provided in NumPy arrays which allow multiple
    points to be queried at once. The arrays must have the same shape,
    which can otherwise be arbitrary.

    The return values are `quadrant`, `height`, `slope`, and `factor`.
    The first three of these are indices into an ADRT output (as in
    :pycode:`adrt_out[quadrant, height, slope]`), and the final
    coordinate is a scaling factor which may be applied to the value
    of this entry. The output arrays all have the same shape as the
    input arrays `theta` and `t`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    theta : numpy.ndarray of float
        Angle :math:`\theta` coordinates in continuous Radon space, in
        radians to be converted to the closest ADRT index.
    t : numpy.ndarray of float
        Offset :math:`t` coordinates in continuous Radon space. In
        normalized coordinates between :math:`-1/\sqrt{2}` and
        :math:`1/\sqrt{2}`.
    n : int
        The size of the ADRT domain. Either the size of the input
        image :pycode:`(n, n)`, or equivalently the final dimension of
        the ADRT output :pycode:`(4, 2*n-1, n)`. Must be a power of
        two.

    Returns
    -------
    quadrant : numpy.ndarray of numpy.uint8
        Quadrant indices in ADRT domain. These are integers from
        :pycode:`0` through :pycode:`3`, inclusive.
    height : numpy.ndarray of numpy.int64
        The intercept indices in the ADRT domain.
    slope : numpy.ndarray of numpy.uint64
        The slope/angle indices in the ADRT domain.
    factor : numpy.ndarray of numpy.float64
        A transformation factor for each identified ADRT entry.

    Notes
    -----
    When the provided `theta` value is a multiple of :math:`\pi/4` and
    so lies exactly on the boundary between quadrants, the height and
