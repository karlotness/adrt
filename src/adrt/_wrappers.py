def adrt(a: npt.NDArray[F], /) -> npt.NDArray[F]:
    r"""The Approximate Discrete Radon Transform (ADRT).

    This is the fundamental routine of this package, computing the
    ADRT of the provided array. The array `a` must store square input
    images with sizes a power of two. The input may optionally include
    an additional leading batch dimension, so an array of either two
    or three dimensions.

    If padding is needed for the input array, consider
    :func:`numpy.pad`.

    The returned array will have the shape of an ADRT output of size
    N. The output is divided into four quadrants, each one less than
    twice as tall as the input. The taller height dimension represents
    ADRT offsets, while the final dimension has the same size as the
    input and represents the ADRT angles.

    For more information on the construction of the quadrants and the
    contents of this array see: :ref:`adrt-description`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : numpy.ndarray of float
        Array for which the ADRT should be computed. This should be a
        square image with side length a power of two, and optionally a
        leading batch dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray of float
        The ADRT of the provided data. For input images of size ``N``,
        each member of the batch will have shape ``(4, 2*N-1, N)``.

    Notes
    -----
    The transform implemented here is an approximation to the Radon
    transform and *approximates* the sums along lines with carefully
    chosen angles. Each quadrant slices along a range of :math:`\pi/4`
    radians. For a detailed description of the algorithm see
    :ref:`adrt-description` and refer to the source papers [#brady98]_

    r"""Compute a single step of the ADRT.

    The ADRT implemented in :func:`adrt.adrt` is internally an
    iterative algorithm. Sums along line segments of a given length
    are approximated by joining sums along line segments of half
    length in a bottom-up fashion from segments of length two.

    This function allows you to run a single step of the ADRT in order
    to observe the outputs (for example to read off sums of partial
    line segments) or to modify the values as the computation proceeds
    (for example, to mask certain values as they grow).

    To use this function correctly, use :func:`adrt.core.adrt_init` to
    initialize your input array. The argument `a` to this function
    should either be the result of :func:`adrt_init` or a previous
    output of this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : numpy.ndarray of float
        The array for which the single ADRT step should be computed.
    step : int
        The step to compute. The upper bound on this value should be
        computed using :func:`num_iters`, then `step` must be between
        :math:`0` and :math:`\mathtt{num\_iters}-1`, inclusive.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray of float
        The result of the `step` iteration of the ADRT. The output has
        the same shape as the input.

    Note
    ----
    If you only want the result of the last step (the full ADRT) and
    are not interested in the intermediate steps, use the more

    Computes an exact inverse to the ADRT, but only works for exact
    ADRT outputs. The array `a` may have an optional batch dimension
    with the shape of an ADRT output.

    The returned array has the same shape as `a`, but each quadrant
    should have only zeros below the square at the top of the array.
    However, this may not be the case due to conditioning or
    imprecision in the calculations performed by this routine.

    The upper square of each quadrant can be extracted and rotated
    using :func:`adrt.utils.truncate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : numpy.ndarray of float
        An ADRT output for which to compute the inverse.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray of float
        The computed inverse with the same shape as `a`.

    Warning
    -------
    This inverse is ill-conditioned and will be exact *only* if `a` is
    an exact output of the forward ADRT and the floating point type
    provides sufficient precision. In other cases this inverse is not
    appropriate.

    For an alternative, see the :doc:`examples.cginverse` example.

    The transform implemented in :func:`adrt` is a linear operation.
    This function computes a generalized transpose of this operation,
    producing an output with the same shape as its input.

    To retrieve the entries of the transpose of the ADRT in the proper
    order, apply :func:`adrt.utils.truncate` to the array produced by
    this function. The truncation operation will remove the extended
    entries and rotate each quadrant into the same orientation as the
    original, square shape ADRT input. The quadrants can then be
    combined, if desired, potentially by :func:`numpy.mean`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : numpy.ndarray of float

    The angles and offsets used in an ADRT output are irregularly-spaced to
    enable reuse of intermediate calculations.  This routine provides a basic
    interpolation operation which resamples these angles into an even-spacing.

    The ADRT result is interpolated into a uniform Cartesian grid in the Radon
    domain :math:`(\theta, t)`. Where :math:`\theta` is the normal direction of
    the line, and :math:`t` is the distance of the line to the origin. Upon a
    coordinate transformation, a nearest neighbor interpolation is performed.

    For an ADRT output of size ``N``, the interpolated array has shape
