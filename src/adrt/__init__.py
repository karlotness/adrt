r"""Fast approximate discrete Radon transform for NumPy arrays.

The ``adrt`` package provides a fast implementation of an approximate
discrete Radon transform and several related routines such as
backprojection, inverses, and utilities.

This main module contains the basic functions of the package, designed
to be simple to use. The module :mod:`adrt.core` contains lower-level
routines which provide more control over the computation. Other
utility routines can be found in :mod:`adrt.utils`.

    r"""Approximate inverse to the ADRT by the full multigrid method.

    Estimated inverses are computed and iteratively refined until the
    norm of the residual error fails to decrease from one iteration to
    the next. This iteration can also be terminated early if
    `max_iters` is specified.

    Particularly with a limited iteration count this inverse can be
    relatively quick to compute, but may not achieve the best possible
    precision. If your output array `a` is *exact* and floating-point
    precision is sufficient you may consider :func:`iadrt` for an
    exact inverse. Otherwise, for an inverse that may perform more
    reliably for certain inputs, consider the ``iadrt_cg`` recipe
    proposed in the :doc:`examples.cginverse` example.

    See :func:`adrt.core.iadrt_fmg_iter` and
    :func:`adrt.core.iadrt_fmg_step` for more information on the
    iterative refinement applied internally and the full multigrid
    method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : numpy.ndarray of float
        The array for which the inverse is to be computed. This array
        must have the shape of an ADRT output. This array *must not*
        have a batch dimension.
    max_iters : int, optional
        If :pycode:`None` (default), the number of internal iterations
        is unbounded. The computation will terminate only when the
        norm of the residual error fails to decrease. Otherwise, this
        must be an integer argument at least :pycode:`1`, and provides
        an upper bound on the number of iterations performed
        internally.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray of float
        A square inverse computed by the full multigrid method with
        the lowest residual error observed so long as the decrease was
        monotonic, or the last computation output if iteration was
        terminated by `max_iters`.

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike :func:`iadrt` the output of this routine will be
    square---the same size as the original input to :func:`adrt` would
    have been.

    This function *does not* support batch dimensions.
